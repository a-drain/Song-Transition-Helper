# Song-Transition-Helper

## Program Purpose
Assists a user in determining the optimal next song to play on a Spotify playlist to max out transition fluidity

## Overview of Code
### Song Class
Stores all the **name** of the song, the **BPM**, and the **Camelot Code**
There is also a method that **displays song data**

### Driver
Other than **main**, the driver also has a method that determines the best song to play next.

### Special Notes
1. Format of File needs to be as follows: song number (not used), song name, song BPM, song Camelot
2. REMEMBER TO REMOVE ANY UNNECCESARY SPACES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE!!
3. Use this link to access a CSV of a Spotify playlist: https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-analyzer/ (Note that you will need a Spotify link to access your playlist!!)
4. Make sure that there are no repeats in the playlist! Spotify shouldn't allow this, but just in case double check to make sure that there are no
repeated songs!
